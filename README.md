üìä Google Search Trends Analysis - README
Overview
This app allows users to upload a CSV file containing Google Search Trends data and perform various analyses on the data, including:
1.	Trend Visualization: Visualizing the search trends of different topics over time.
2.	Correlation Analysis: Analyzing the relationships between different topics.
3.	Clustering Topics Based on Trends: Using clustering techniques to group similar topics based on their search trends.
4.	Time-Series Forecasting: Predicting future search trends for a selected topic using the Prophet model.
The app uses the Streamlit library for interactive web apps, Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization, and Scikit-learn for clustering. It also leverages Prophet for time-series forecasting.

How to Use the App
1.	Upload Dataset:
    o	Click on the "üìÇ Upload Dataset" section to upload your CSV file.
    o	The dataset should contain a 'Month' column (in YYYY-MM format) and multiple columns representing different topics.
  	o	Ensure that the topics contain numerical values representing the search interest for each month.
3.	Trend Visualization:
    o	In the "1Ô∏è‚É£ Trend Visualization" section, choose a topic from the dropdown menu.
    o	The app will plot the search interest for the selected topic over time, using a line graph.
    o	This helps you visualize how the search interest for a particular topic has evolved over time.
4.	Correlation Analysis:
    o	In the "2Ô∏è‚É£ Correlation Analysis" section, the app will automatically compute and display a heatmap showing the correlation between various topics in the dataset.
    o	The correlation matrix helps you understand the strength of relationships between different topics based on their search trends.
5.	Clustering Topics Based on Trends:
    o	In the "3Ô∏è‚É£ Clustering Topics Based on Trends" section, you can choose the number of clusters you want (2 to 10).
    o	The app uses KMeans clustering to group topics based on the similarity of their search trends.
    o	After performing clustering, the app will display a Cluster Summary (average search trends per cluster) and a Cluster Centroids Heatmap showing the center of each cluster.
6.	Time-Series Forecasting:
    o	In the "4Ô∏è‚É£ Time-Series Forecasting" section, you can select a topic for forecasting.
    o	The app uses the Prophet model to predict future search trends for the selected topic.
    o	It plots the forecasted values along with the historical data, giving you an idea of how the trend might evolve.

Detailed Functionality
1Ô∏è‚É£ Trend Visualization
  ‚Ä¢	Goal: Visualize the search interest over time for a selected topic.
  ‚Ä¢	Graph: A line chart is plotted with time on the x-axis and search interest on the y-axis. 
  o	The x-axis represents time in monthly intervals (from the 'Month' column).
  o	The y-axis represents the search interest, which can be thought of as a numerical representation of how frequently the topic was searched on Google.
Insights:
  ‚Ä¢	Peaks in the graph indicate periods when the topic saw a significant increase in search interest.
  ‚Ä¢	Valleys or plateaus represent times of reduced or stable interest in the topic.
  ‚Ä¢	Seasonality can be observed if the search interest consistently rises or falls at certain times of the year, which could indicate cyclical trends.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Correlation Analysis
  ‚Ä¢	Goal: Analyze how different topics are related to each other in terms of their search trends.
  ‚Ä¢	Graph: A heatmap shows the correlation matrix of the search trends of all topics. 
    o	The color intensity in the heatmap indicates the strength of the correlation (from -1 to +1).
    o	A value of 1 indicates a perfect positive correlation (i.e., both topics move in the same direction), -1 indicates a perfect negative correlation (i.e., as one increases, the other decreases), and 0 indicates no correlation.
Insights:
  ‚Ä¢	Strong positive correlations (values close to 1) mean that the topics tend to have similar search trends.
  ‚Ä¢	Strong negative correlations (values close to -1) suggest that as one topic's search interest increases, the other decreases.
  ‚Ä¢	Topics with weak correlations (values closer to 0) behave independently of each other.
  ‚Ä¢	This analysis can help identify if certain topics are related or if there are trends that evolve in opposition to each other.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Clustering Topics Based on Trends
‚Ä¢	Goal: Group similar topics based on their search trends into clusters.
  ‚Ä¢	Method: The app uses KMeans clustering:
    o	First, the data is standardized using StandardScaler so that all topics have a similar scale.
    o	Then, KMeans clustering is applied to group the topics based on their similarity.
    o	The number of clusters is user-defined (ranging from 2 to 10).
      ‚Ä¢	Cluster Summary: After clustering, the average search trend for each cluster is shown, helping to understand the behavior of each group of topics.
      ‚Ä¢	Cluster Centroids Heatmap: A heatmap shows the average search trend for each topic within a cluster.
    o	This helps identify which topics are at the center of each cluster, representing the typical behavior of each group.
Insights:
  ‚Ä¢	Each cluster represents a group of topics that share similar trends over time.
  ‚Ä¢	Clusters can help identify related topics that might be grouped together for further analysis or marketing.
  ‚Ä¢	For example, a cluster might contain topics related to seasonal events, while another cluster might contain topics related to evergreen interest (topics that consistently have interest over time).

4Ô∏è‚É£ Time-Series Forecasting
‚Ä¢	Goal: Predict future search trends for a selected topic using the Prophet model.
  ‚Ä¢	Method: 
    o	The app uses Prophet, a time-series forecasting tool developed by Facebook.
    o	The Month column is used as the time series (ds), and the selected topic‚Äôs search interest is used as the value (y).
    o	The model is trained on the historical data, and then predictions are made for the next 12 months.
Insights:
  ‚Ä¢	The forecast plot shows the predicted search trend for the selected topic, along with historical data.
  ‚Ä¢	The forecast can help identify whether the interest in a topic is likely to increase or decrease in the future.
  ‚Ä¢	If the forecasted trend has a sharp rise, it could indicate a potential opportunity for businesses or marketers to capitalize on the growing interest in that topic.
  ‚Ä¢	Confidence intervals (shown in shaded areas) give a range for the forecast, showing the uncertainty in the predictions.
